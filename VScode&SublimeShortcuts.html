****************** Jquery ajax ****************

NOTE: jqery call will always be in $(document).ready(function(){}

Two methods
1) $.ajax(url, type, data, callback function);
$.ajax(abc.php,post,name=sandeep)
e.g-> $.ajax({
url:"abc.php",
type:"post",
data: $("#myform input").serialize(), // It will bind all the keys with their values of the form.
// firstname=sandeep&lastname=kumar.Now $firstname = sandeep
sucess:function(data){
console.log(data); // It will print the response from server.
},
});

To get the values on abc.php, we need to extract the request or post data.
extract($_POST);


2) $.post(url,data,callback function);
e.g-> $.post("abc.php",
{firstname:sandeep,lastname:kumar}, // var firstname = $("#fname").val(); = sandeep
function(data,status){ // data is the response from the server.
$(#textchange).html(data);
});

To get the values on abc.php:
$fname = $_REQUEST['firstname'];


****************** Wordpress *******************

For the landing of the website
If from the admin "Your latest posts" is set then it will work like below:
front-page.php > home.php.index.php

For internal pages = Template file > Page.php > Index.php

For displaying menu link content.

If General Settings(Posts Page) is set home.php/index.php > Template file > Page.php > Index file


front-page.php > Page.php > index.php


Single.php is for displaying the full detail of post.
Singular.php is also for displaying the post in the absence of Single.php

Single.php > Singular.php > Index.php

Page.php is for displaying the detail page.
Singular.php is also used for displaying the full detail page in the absence of the page.php


Page.php > Singular.php > Index.php

Singular.php is for the displaying the detail page of both Posts and Pages in the absence of their masters
files(Single.php and Page.php).

index.php and home.php both are same files used to display the posts.
home.php > index.php
So, if home.php is present, then landing page will be home.php not index.php
If we want to display the posts on menu link (Home/Blog/Any), then we can set it from the admin->Settings->Reading->Post
Page. It will display the lisiting of the posts on that page.


******************Plugin development*************

Create a custom folder and inside this create a file name same as folder name.

action_hook = admin_menu calling method add_menu_page and for sub menu add_submenu_page

Directoy path to include php files = plugin_dir_path(__FILE__);
Url path to include images/js/css = plugins_url();

To css and js files, it should be in the main file(pluginname.php) just as function.php and we will call these methods
by action hooks.
add_action('init','functionname') = wp_enqueue_style()/wp_enqueue_script() to add style and scripts.

register_activation_hook(__FILE__,''); is used to create a table at the time of plugin activation.
On deactivation of plugin = register_deactivation_hook(__FILE__,'');
On deletion of plugin = register_uninstall_hook(__FILE,''); => Will delete the files also.

wp_insert_post($page); where $page is an array.$page['post_title'],$page['post_content'],$page['post_slug']
